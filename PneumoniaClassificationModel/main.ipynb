    "Machine learning has a phenomenal range of applications, including in health and diagnostics. This tutorial will explain the complete pipeline from loading data to predicting results, and it will explain how to build an X-ray image classification model from scratch to predict whether an X-ray scan shows presence of pneumonia. This is especially useful during these current times as COVID-19 is known to cause pneumonia.\n",

Data augmentation is not included in the model because X-ray scans are only taken in a specific orientation, and variations such as flips and rotations will not exist in real X-ray images.\n",

The original PANDA dataset contains large images and masks that specify which area of the mask led to the ISUP grade (determines the severity of the cancer). Since the original images contain a lot of white space and extraneous data that is not necessary for our model, we will be using tiles to condense the images. Basically, the tiles are small sections of the masked areas, and these tiles can be concatenated together so the only the masked sections of the original image remains."
